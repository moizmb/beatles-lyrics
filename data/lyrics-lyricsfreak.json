In the cap she looked much older And the bag across her shoulder Made her look a little like a military man. Lovely Rita meter maid, may I inquire discreetly, When you are free to take some tea with me Took her out and tried to win her, Had a laugh and over dinner Told her I would really like to see her again Got the bill and Rita paid it, Took her home and nearly made it Sitting on a sofa with a sister or two. Oh, lovely Rita meter maid, where would I be without you, Give us a wink and make me think of you", "song": "Lovely Rita", "songwriters": ["john lennon", "paul mccartney"]}
